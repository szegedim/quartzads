# QuartzAds

## Advertising Technology

# Summary

We created this as an alternative to Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, TikTok Ads, etc.

You can just place ads and pay for them. The specialty is that we share logs, so that you can double check results of other ad sites.

The content can be configured at startup making it very flexible. It is like the founding age of the internet in the late 1990s.

We do not use and discourage cookies. The reason is that they require legal opt-ins that slow down prospective customers. Cookies lower the click through rate.

This is a demo for fundraising. See www.showmycard.comâ„ 

The business logic is simple. You can collect some of the advertisers who did not get their required return at other ad sites due to a competitor with bigger marketing budget.

We encourage distributed marketing as a result. You borrow the content and put ads on it. You can cluster more advertisers and pay traffic. The system grows until all advertisers find their audience.

Please make sure to buy the rights to any intellectual property that you use.

Example:

- You create a cluster promoting multiple advertisers. People tend to stay more and spend more in such districts.
- You negotiate and proxy an interior design and furniture page from a generative content site.
- You pay $50 to get 6000 impressions.
- You sell ads on the page to thirty advertisers $2 each for the same period.
- They get the brand marketing and the market data that would cost $50 each otherwise.
- You make $10 profits.
